Skip to the next song on your playlists from anywhere in Chrome.

Use keyboard shortcuts to skip to the next and previous song on your playlist from any tab in the Chrome browser. You can set global shortcuts so that this will when you are using other applications as well!

You can set the tab which is running your playlist (if you have multiple YouTube tabs open), and use shortcuts to go backward and forward in the playlist.

Set the shortcuts in chrome://extensions at Keyboard Shortcuts at the bottom of the page.
